---

* Reset browser defaut
* Remove invalid styles rules for `<img>` tag
* Remove no used `class` and `<div>`
* Fixing spaces and reduce code lines with `padding`,`margin` and `gap`
* Added `box-shadow` and `text-shadow` for better contrast
* color adjustment for better readability
* Create a `:hover` effect because looks cooler

Suggest: 
* Change tag `<p>...</p>` to `<h2>...</h2>`
